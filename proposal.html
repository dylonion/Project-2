  <h1>Parking Data</h1>

      <h2>Concept:</h2>
      <p>Owning a car in NYC is a pain in the ass. Every street has street cleaning rules for both sides which make that street a no-parking zone for 2-3 hours,
        once per week. You get a $60 ticket if you don't move your car. It can be difficult to remember both where you've parked and what time you are supposed to
        move, especially if you are sharing your car with other people.<br>
        I'd like to make an app that can access your GPS data, plug it into google's API, and then apply that information to a database of parking rules that the NYC
        Dept. of transportation maintains (which is available in csv format on their website, along with other
        <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/datafeeds.shtml#parking">interesting stuff</a>). Users would be able to take note of their location automatically,
        share it with other owners, and receive messages before their car is due to be moved (whether through email, text, push notifications,etc TBD).
      </p>

      <h2>Code planning:</h2>
      <p>The code structure of the program would be that of the standard MVC app, with a backend API call to google maps. The project poses a couple of new problems
      for me though - </p>
      <ul>
        <li>learn how to take several massive CSV files and programmatically convert them into a DB. They Do have a search feature on their website, </li>
        <li>learn how to send emails or w/e kind of notifications through express</li>
        <li>learn how to schedule automatic tasks for the server through crontab or w/e</li>
        <li>learn how to pull locational data from a client.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on their difficulty, some of this functionality will be left to the end. Is the concept itself too dependant upon technologies that I don't yet
      know how to use? Without being able to request location data, it's hard to imagine someone actually taking the time to take out their current address whenever they park.
      It would have to be something more convenient.</p>

      <h2>Wireframes:</h2>
      <p>In progress.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2>Phases of completion:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Working MVC app on localhost - basic routes, views, models, controllers. A mock DB to pull on.</li>
        <li>Convert NYCDOT's csv files to a DB, and implement google's API calls with user input data.</li>
        <li>Auth.</li>
        <li>Bonus tech - location data</li>
        <li>Bonus tech - emails</li>
        <li>Bonus tech - crontab</li>
